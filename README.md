# Uno-Card-Game

// Update 31.08.2023
The Uno Card Project has been put on hold for now. Despite my Java studies teacher's warning against using a "scanner," as I progressed through Tim Buchalka's "Java Programming Masterclass" Course, I noticed him employing that tool frequently and thought, "why not?" Well, it was "fun" and somewhat useful in the initial stages of code development. However, as I delved deeper, I realized the extent of code changes required to make it function effectively.

At present, my primary goal is to develop the "Burger Restaurant" project. Once I've taken that project to the desired stage (which entails incorporating REST API utilities, adding a database, some front-end work... quite an undertaking), I will certainly revisit the Uno Card project. My intention is to transform it into a simple single-player or even online game. While this is my aspiration, I am fully aware that I need to acquire a substantial amount of knowledge to attain it. But yes, that's my objective, and I am resolute in achieving it.

Cheers!
